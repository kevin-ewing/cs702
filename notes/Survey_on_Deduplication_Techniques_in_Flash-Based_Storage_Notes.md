# Survey on Deduplication Techniques in Flash-Based Storage

## First Pass

- Data deduplication is more important than it ever has been due to data growing faster than ever.
- Ever since solid sate drives (SSDs) there have been new issues with deduplication that this paper hopes to classify
- Paper presents a full survey on deduplication techniques
- Data deduplication overall has the benefits of:
    - Reducing traffic
    - Increasing data density
    - Decreasing energy consumption
- SSDs are advantageous for deduplication due to high random reed speed (in contrast to the performance degradation due to fragmentation on a conventional hard disk drive (HDD))
- Since the early 2000s, data deduplication has grown larger in its role in storage systems
    - Proven advantages to reduce the number of writes and increase disk lifetime, faster writing, and save storage space
