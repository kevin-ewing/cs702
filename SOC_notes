            Attempting to get linux on the machine running ZFS and btrFS
Jan 24:
    Reading BTRFS_The_Linux_B-tree_Filesystem.pdf -> good amount of similarities to ZFS but fundamentally different hierarchical structure
        No concrete mention of -`reflink`s but does a great job outlining btrFS basics and how writing and freeing blocks works
    Re exploring this feature request on ZFS https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/405 and https://github.com/pjd/openzfs/commit/83921c797a65fbc46a72e2a90c40822a988dee28
